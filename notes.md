### Further Explanation and Clarification of Chinese National Pentatonic Modes Theory and Ancient Chinese Music

- The Chinese national pentatonic modes theory was proposed by Chinese musicians after the 20th century, combining Chinese and western music theories. Although it cannot analyze all types of Chinese music, it can be applied to most of the traditional Chinese music pieces.
- In ancient China, the Sanfen Sunyi Lü (三分损益律) was the basis for the generation of scales. The most common scales of Yayue, Yanyue and Qingyue are produced on the basis of this tuning system.
- The famous 28-modes, 84-modes and other systematic modes theories of the Tang (唐) and Song (宋) Dynasties were also produced on the basis of the Sanfen Sunyi Lü, but the pentatonic modes theory of Chinese national style did not absorb these modes theories of Tang and Song music.
- In ancient China, Lü(s) were used to express the absolute pitch standard of tones. The most commonly used twelve-Lü (十二律) includes Huangzhong (黄钟), Dalü (大吕), Taicu (太簇), Jiazhong (夹钟), Guxian (姑冼), Zhonglü (中吕), Ruibin (蕤宾), Linzhong (林钟), Yize (夷则), Nanlü (南吕), Wuyi (无射) and Yingzhong (应钟).
- The ancient records and the unearthed Han Dynasty Wuyi Lüguan (无射律管) prove that Chinese court music has a tradition of exploring the absolute pitch of Huangzhong [1]. But this tradition did not continue after the decline of the ancient court, and the absolute pitch of the court music has not been applied by the folk.
